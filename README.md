# Hippo-seq: Single-Cell Hippocampus Analysis

A comprehensive resource for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the mouse hippocampus.

## Core Features

### Hippocampus Cell Atlas (HCA)
- >420,000 cells across 33 distinct cell types
- Interactive visualization and gene expression analysis
- Advanced co-expression analysis tools

### Post-Hypoxia-Ischemia Atlas
- 27,380 nuclei from sham, hypoxia, and hypoxia-ischemia conditions
- Early timepoint (3-hour) transcriptional response
- Cell-type specific vulnerability analysis

## Analysis Tools
- Interactive web portal and automated cell type annotation is implemented at [hippo-seq.org](http://hippo-seq.org). Custom gene set analysis and integration with HCA and post-HI atlases.
- R package for cell type annotation of Hippocampus is integrated via [ScType package](https://github.com/IanevskiAleksandr/sc-type)  <b>A corresponding section will be added to ScType annotation after the paper is accepted.</b>
